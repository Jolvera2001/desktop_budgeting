# Overview

This is a project to explore more about the Wails framework. This aims to be a small, simple budgeting app that uses SQLite and is meant to be an offline type of desktop application.

I've been exploring a lot of desktop development application frameworks and Wails already seems like a promising one. Things like .net Maui, WPF, Tauri, or Electron have had something that always made me steer away from using them (Tauri looked great but I have Rust skill issues). And since I'm recently learning Go, this seemed like a great way to get back into desktop development.

## Goals

- Learn more about Wails
- Complete a set of features to make the app "complete"
- See if the application can expand as it nears "completion"
